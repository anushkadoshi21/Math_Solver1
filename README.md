# Math_Solver1
A webapp for kids for practising basic mathematics !
This webapp recognises the handwritten numbers and acts acoordingly.
The neural nets are trained on MNIST dataset and the model was saved and then converted to the json format.
There are many bugs and problems do occur while using Tensorflow, Tensorflowsjs and OpenCV.

The following combination worked best for me =========>

Tensorflow => v1
Tensorflowjs => 1.2.3
OpenCV => 4.0.1
